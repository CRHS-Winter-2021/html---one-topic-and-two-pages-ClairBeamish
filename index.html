        <p>This project took about 5 years to complete. The first year we opened our idea to investors(KickStarter) we had enough to buy out disney and amazon so we did, our profits sky rocketed quite literally. the next year we spent finishing the plans. In our third year we started building and bought out space-x and Elon Musk. For the next 2 years we finished the building of the amusement park and our hotels. This is where our adventure ends but this is where your adventure begins.</p>
